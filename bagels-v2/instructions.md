# Bagels V2 Instructions

In this version of Bagels, the secret number can be any length between 2 and 10 digits. Additionally, you will have a limited number of guesses, which will decrease by one each time you make a guess. You will also be allowed to make several different types of guesses:

-   A normal guess, where you guess a number and get the standard “Pico”, “Fermi”, or “Bagels” hint.

-   A “Hint” guess, where you ask for a hint instead of making a guess. You will receive one hint about the secret number for each hint guess you make. However, each hint guess will also decrease your remaining number of guesses by one.

-   A “Force” guess, where you force the game to tell you the correct answer. You will lose the game immediately if you make a force guess.
