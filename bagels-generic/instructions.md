# Bagels Instructions

In Bagels, a deductive logic game, you must guess a secret three-digit number based on clues. 

The game offers one of the following hints in response to your guess: 
- “Pico” when your guess has a correct digit in the wrong place 
- “Fermi” when your guess has a correct digit in the correct place
- “Bagels” if your guess has no correct digits. 

Player will have 10 tries to guess the secret number.

## How It Works

Keep in mind that this program uses not integer values but rather string values that contain numeric digits. For example, `'426'` is a different value than `426`. We need to do this because we are performing string comparisons with the secret number, not math operations. Remember that `'0'` can be a leading digit: the string `'026'` is different from `'26'`, but the integer `026` is the same as `26`.

I am thinking of a 3-digit number. Try to guess what it is.
Here are some clues:
When I say:    That means:
  Pico         One digit is correct but in the wrong position.
  Fermi        One digit is correct and in the right position.
  Bagels       No digit is correct.
I have thought up a number.
 You have 10 guesses to get it.
Guess #1:
> 123
Pico
Guess #2:
> 456
Bagels
Guess #3:
> 178
Pico Pico
--snip--
Guess #7:
> 791
Fermi Fermi
Guess #8:
> 701
You got it!
Do you want to play again? (yes or no)
> no
Thanks for playing!
