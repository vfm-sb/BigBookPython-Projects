# Calendar Maker - Instructions

This program generates printable text files of monthly calendars for the month and year you enter. 

Dates and calendars are a tricky topic in programming because there are so many different rules for determining the number of days in a month, which years are leap years, and which day of the week a particular date falls on. 

Fortunately, Pythonâ€™s `datetime` module handles these details for you. 

This program focuses on generating the multiline string for the monthly calendar page.

## How It Works

Note that the `getCalendarFor()` function returns a giant multiline string of the calendar for the given month and year. 

In this function, the `calText` variable stores this string, which adds the lines, spaces, and dates to it. 

To track the date, the `currentDate` variable holds a `datetime.date()` object, which gets set to the next or previous date by adding or subtracting `datetime.timedelta()` objects.
